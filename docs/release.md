title: Releases
order: 30

Releases are generated by the build process, and consumed by the deploy process.
They are an internal data interchange format between the two processes.
They are not intended to be edited.

The documentation here is thus only for informational purposes.

# Top-level Properties

## version

The top-level `version` property contains an integer giving the verison of this file.
Taskcluster-installer can read some older versions of releases, but sufficiently old versions will result in an error (for example, if they reference functionality that is no longer supported).

## services

The top-level `services` property contains an array of services that may be deployed.
Each entry has the following keys:

* `name` - service name
* `source` - the git URL, with the sha1 in the fragment, from which this image was built
* `dockerImage` - a reference to the docker image to deploy (in the format `<registry>/<repo>:<tag>`
